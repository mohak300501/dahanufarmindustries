# Code Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The codebase has been refactored from large monolithic files into smaller, focused components and services for better maintainability, reusability, and code organization.

## New File Structure

### Types (`src/types/index.ts`)
Centralized type definitions used across the application:
- `Post` - Interface for community posts
- `Comment` - Interface for post comments
- `Community` - Interface for community data
- `Member` - Interface for user member data

### Hooks (`src/hooks/`)
Custom React hooks for shared logic:
- `useAuth.ts` - Authentication state management and user role checking

### Services (`src/services/`)
Business logic and API calls separated from UI components:
- `communityService.ts` - All community-related database operations
- `adminService.ts` - All admin-related database operations

### Components

#### Community Components (`src/components/community/`)
- `CommunityHeader.tsx` - Community title, description, and join/leave functionality
- `PostCard.tsx` - Individual post display with interactions (like, dislike, comment, delete)
- `CreatePostDialog.tsx` - Dialog for creating new posts
- `CommentDialog.tsx` - Dialog for adding comments to posts
- `LeaveCommunityDialog.tsx` - Confirmation dialog for leaving communities

#### Admin Components (`src/components/admin/`)
- `AdminStats.tsx` - Statistics display (members, communities, villages)
- `MemberFilter.tsx` - Filtering interface for member management
- `MembersTable.tsx` - Table displaying all members with actions
- `CommunitiesTable.tsx` - Table displaying all communities with actions
- `CreateCommunityDialog.tsx` - Dialog for creating new communities
- `DeleteCommunityDialog.tsx` - Confirmation dialog for community deletion

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- UI components are now focused solely on presentation
- Business logic is separated into service files
- Data fetching is centralized in services

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be easily reused across different parts of the application
- Services can be imported and used by multiple components
- Hooks provide reusable state management logic

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
- Changes to business logic don't require touching UI components
- Clear separation makes debugging easier

### 4. **Testing**
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Services can be mocked for component testing
- Business logic can be unit tested separately

### 5. **Code Organization**
- Related functionality is grouped together
- Clear file naming conventions
- Index files provide clean import paths

## Migration Summary

### Before Refactoring
- `CommunityPostsPage.tsx`: 469 lines
- `AdminPage.tsx`: 457 lines
- All logic mixed with UI components
- Duplicate code across files
- Hard to test individual pieces

### After Refactoring
- `CommunityPostsPage.tsx`: ~200 lines (57% reduction)
- `AdminPage.tsx`: ~180 lines (61% reduction)
- 15+ focused, single-purpose components
- Centralized business logic in services
- Reusable hooks for common functionality

## Usage Examples

### Using Services
```typescript
import { communityService } from '../services';

// Load community data
const community = await communityService.loadCommunityData(communityName);

// Create a post
await communityService.createPost(communityId, postData);
```

### Using Hooks
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../hooks';

const { user, userRole, isJoined, loading } = useAuth(communityName);
```

### Using Components
```typescript
import { CommunityHeader, PostCard } from '../components/community';

<CommunityHeader
  community={communityData}
  user={user}
  isJoined={isJoined}
  onJoin={handleJoin}
  onLeave={handleLeave}
/>
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Add more hooks** for common patterns (usePosts, useCommunities, etc.)
2. **Implement error boundaries** for better error handling
3. **Add loading states** to individual components
4. **Create utility functions** for common operations
5. **Add TypeScript strict mode** for better type safety
6. **Implement component testing** with Jest and React Testing Library

## File Size Comparison

| File | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| CommunityPostsPage.tsx | 469 lines | ~200 lines | 57% |
| AdminPage.tsx | 457 lines | ~180 lines | 61% |
| **Total** | **926 lines** | **~380 lines** | **59%** |

The refactoring has significantly reduced the size of the main page files while improving code organization and maintainability.
